# Exercise Solutions Chapter 6 #
## 1. ##
Test run of the eight programs presented in this chapter.  
 - [program_06_01.c](Exercise_01/Program_06_01/program_06_01.c)  
 - [program_06_02.c](Exercise_01/Program_06_02/program_06_02.c)  
 - [program_06_03.c](Exercise_01/Program_06_03/program_06_03.c)  
 - [program_06_04.c](Exercise_01/Program_06_04/program_06_04.c)  
 - [program_06_05.c](Exercise_01/Program_06_05/program_06_05.c)  
 - [program_06_06.c](Exercise_01/Program_06_06/program_06_06.c)  
 - [program_06_07.c](Exercise_01/Program_06_07/program_06_07.c)  
 - [program_06_08.c](Exercise_01/Program_06_08/program_06_08.c)  

## 2. ##
Program 6.1 again, but this time with an initial for loop that sets all values of the array to 0.  
 - [exercise_06_02.c](Exercise_02/exercise_06_02.c)  

## 3. ##
Program 6.2 again, but there is no longer a fixed number of responses. The user can enter any number of responses and ends the input by typing in 999.    
 - [exercise_06_03.c](Exercise_03/exercise_06_03.c)  

## 4. ##
Program to calculate the average of some values.    
 - [exercise_06_04.c](Exercise_04/exercise_06_04.c)  

## 5. ##
The expected output from the [program](Exercise_05/exercise_06_05.c) in this exercise is  
```
1 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
```
The program is based around an array that holds ten integers. A given value in the array is set to the sum of all values before the given value, except for the very first value that is set to 1.  

## 6. ##
Program that calculates and prints the first 15 Fibonacci numbers. Only three variables are needed to store the numbers in this implementation.  
- [exercise_06_06.c](Exercise_06/exercise_06_06.c)  

## 7. ##
Program that implements a version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers.  
 - [exercise_06_07.c](Exercise_07/exercise_06_07.c)  

## 8. ##
Program that calculates the dot product of two vectors by the use of variable length arrays.  
 - [exercise_06_08.c](Exercise_08/exercise_06_08.c)
